    "- Note that all metrics has large range between the min and max, indicating that there are extreme values, and all the standard deviations indicate considerable variability among the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Bid Ask Spread:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Note that we did not exclude the negative bid ask spread, so the min of spread reaches to -13.38 bps. However, from the quantiles, we can see that most spreads are positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 25% of the spreads are less than or equal to 18.1036, 50% (median) are less than or equal to 30.3522, and 75% are less than or equal to 43.6666, showing that most spreads are concentrated in the lower range, which corresponds to the fact that the cleaned data tilts the daily sample toward a more **liquid** subset of corporate bond price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. Return\n",
    "    - The average daily return is small at 1.9293 bps.\n",
    "    - A very high standard deviation relative to the mean (35.8667) indicates large fluctuations in daily returns.\n",
    "    - The min daily return is significantly negative (-410.4720 bps), which could signify a substantial loss.\n",
    "    - The maximum daily return is exceptionally high (1250.0001 bps), pointing to some days with very large gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. Bid ask Bias\n",
    "    - A small average value of mean 0.1387 suggests a slight bias after winsorizing the data to reduce the influence of extreme values. \n",
    "    - The standard deviation is small (0.1501), indicating that the winsorized biases are generally close to the mean.\n",
    "    - The max is 1.8348, showing that even after winsorization, there can be considerable positive bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. Credit Spread\n",
    "    - A mean of 329.0970 bps suggests that on average, the credit risk is regarded as moderate but significant.\n",
    "    - The large standard deviation indicates a wide variation in credit spread across different bonds, which is reasonable since our data captured both the investment grades bond as well as junk bonds.\n",
    "    - The very high max of 6053.5415 bps suggests that for some bonds, the crdit risk is extremely high, which might reflect high yield or distressed bonds."

    "\n",
    "- Note that ```rating``` is the rating data retreived from WRDS and processed by ```load_rating.py```, thus ```rating_stats``` is derived from a much larger sample while the cleaned data ```daily.csv``` tilts toward a more liquid sample by filtering out less frequntly traded bonds. However, the ratios show similar tendencies along the timeframe, with a decreasing ratio of A-and-above and an increasing ratio of BBB during the Post-Crisis to Post-Volcker periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In cleaned data, the proportion of BBB category is higher than raw data, which might indicate that the our data focuses more on BBB category bonds. However, as the cleaned data is derived trading data, which naturally has more trade dates than the rating dates form the rating data, it could also indicates for a higher frequency of trading in BBB category bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In raw rating data, the proportion remains rather steady, but it is noticeable that an increasing ratio of BBB is accompnied by a decreasing ratio of A-and-above, which might indicates that the bond is more likely to transform between these 2 categories.\n"
