FINM 32900 Final Project: Replicating Tables from Noisy Prices and Return-based Anomalies in Corporate Bonds
==================

# About this project

This study endeavors to replicate Table 1 from the research article "Noisy Prices and Return-based Anomalies in Corporate Bonds" authored by Alexander Dickerson, Cesare Robotti, and Giulio Rossetti. Utilizing the TRACE database, we extracted data on corporate bonds and computed various metrics, including bid-ask bias, return, bid-ask spread, and credit spread, across different time periods and bond ratings. Our findings indicate that the replication results for Table 1 closely align with the statistics reported in the original study. However, it is imperative to acknowledge several challenges encountered during our analysis, which may have contributed to slight discrepancies between our results and those presented in the original paper.

# Quick Start

To quickest way to run code in this repo is to use the following steps. First, note that you must have TexLive installed on your computer and available in your path.
You can do this by downloading and installing it from here ([windows](https://tug.org/texlive/windows.html#install) and [mac](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) installers).
Having installed LaTeX, open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project and create a conda environment using the following command:
```
conda create -n blank python=3.12
conda activate finm
```
and then install the dependencies with pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can then run 
```
dodo.py
```
# General Directory Structure

 - The `assets` folder is used for things like hand-drawn figures or other pictures that were not generated from code. These things cannot be easily recreated if they are deleted.

 - The `output` folder, on the other hand, contains tables and figures that are generated from code. The entire folder should be able to be deleted, because the code can be run again, which would again generate all of the contents.

 - I'm using the `doit` Python module as a task runner. It works like `make` and the associated `Makefile`s. To rerun the code, install `doit` (https://pydoit.org/) and execute the command `doit` from the `src` directory. Note that doit is very flexible and can be used to run code commands from the command prompt, thus making it suitable for projects that use scripts written in multiple different programming languages.

 - I'm using the `.env` file as a container for absolute paths that are private to each collaborator in the project. You can also use it for private credentials, if needed. It should not be tracked in Git.

# Data and Output Storage

I'll often use a separate folder for storing data. I usually write code that will pull the data and save it to a directory in the data folder called "pulled"  to let the reader know that anything in the "pulled" folder could hypothetically be deleted and recreated by rerunning the PyDoit command (the pulls are in the dodo.py file).

I'll usually store manually created data in the "assets" folder if the data is small enough. Because of the risk of manually data getting changed or lost, I prefer to keep it under version control if I can.

Output is stored in the "output" directory. This includes tables, charts, and rendered notebooks. When the output is small enough, I'll keep this under version control. I like this because I can keep track of how tables change as my analysis progresses, for example.

Of course, the data directory and output directory can be kept elsewhere on the machine. To make this easy, I always include the ability to customize these locations by defining the path to these directories in environment variables, which I intend to be defined in the `.env` file, though they can also simply be defined on the command line or elsewhere. The `config.py` is reponsible for loading these environment variables and doing some like preprocessing on them. The `config.py` file is the entry point for all other scripts to these definitions. That is, all code that references these variables and others are loading by importing `config`.
